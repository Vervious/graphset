//  Note that the graphset is simply an extension of a
//  probability distribution, with discrete events;
//  if taken to the limit, it becomes a continuous distribution.
//  * Clearly, what we then need is a way to compare
//    discrete and continuous entropy measures
//    (or abstractions with something else)
//
//  Key, intuitive visualizations:
//  * energy: location of a particle.
//  * node: a subspace, or event space. 3D Rectangle.
//  * Abstraction: when a system doesn't know enough to
//    use the full granularity of an object, but the object
//    item exists (e.g. I know that if I turn on a computer,
//    it turns on, but not necessarily what the button did, or
//    all those little details.)
//      - The abstraction event space is strictly greater than
//        any singular instance of its more granular form.

// represents a graph set.
// a graph set defines relationships between its content nodes.
// So far we enforce the fact that all nodes must be connected.
//
// note that the hierarchy can be collapsed by further defining a relationship
// "member" as simply being another connection in the flat graph.
// in that sense, the relationship flat graph is the more general form of this.
// In set theory, we can equate the braces with the arrows in the flat graph.
//
// Actually, not sure if that is true. But here's an interface where
// Each graphset represents an abstraction of an object.
// A graphset can be used as an interface, representing, for instance, the "relationship between x objects"
// For each graphset, you can then add granularity, or children, and define relationships between siblings.
// (Note: If you take a set of graphsets, you then have an object without abstraction.)
// (The way you interact with a set of graphsets is to take its abstraction and define granularity on that level)
//
// This implementation of a graphset is s.t.:
//      - each graphset is responsible for defining the relationships of its children. Let's just experiment.
//      - children do not define relationship with its parent.
//      - actually strike that. Let's just keep track of neighbors.
// Think hierarchally: We could also have every node describe all neighbors, but that's less intuitive in terms
// of the abstraction mechanism.
