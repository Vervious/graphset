 * for the purpose of lerning C++).
 *
 * - currently in memory, but eventually we could persist the knwoledge graph.
 * - could treat **structure like query**
 * - we store connections in a matrix of 1s and 0s. Note that an inhibition would
 *      be formed by a connection to a negative "string", such as "not".
 *      Also note that we could easily store more than 1s and 0s and eliminate the 
 *      need to connect to an inhibitory node; this may be something to look into,
 *      mathematically, in terms of information entropy and all of that.
 * - This requires more research into representation and information entropy. Is
 *      this graph system really the most simple way to represent this sort of structure
