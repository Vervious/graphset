/*
 * Represents an information nexus that has
 * "base knowledge elements", in this case
 * taken to be strings and relationships between strings 
 * (taken to be maybe probablistic, at least for this basic version, 
 * for the purpose of lerning C++).
 *
 * Requires a sort of traversal. How do we interpret this? (And neural signals in general?)
 * - all systems are static, in the universe, unless affected by some sort of energy
 * - a signal is simply the propogation of energy from the external universe on the system
 * - consider it a life force, or driving energy, the "input energy" 
 * - Perhaps it's just another dimension, the universe evolving through time, but lets pick 
 *      this dimension out since we sort of have to
 *
 * Other notes
 * - currently in memory, but eventually we could persist the knwoledge graph.
 * - could treat **structure like query**
 * - we store connections in a matrix of 1s and 0s. Note that an inhibition would
 *      be formed by a connection to a negative "string", such as "not".
 *      Also note that we could easily store more than 1s and 0s and eliminate the 
 *      need to connect to an inhibitory node; this may be something to look into,
 *      mathematically, in terms of information entropy and all of that.
 * - This requires more research into representation and information entropy. Is
 *      this graph system really the most simple way to represent this sort of structure
