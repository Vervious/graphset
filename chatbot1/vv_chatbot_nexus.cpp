    // need to hard code it. This can be done with the parallel mechanism of signalling...
    // ************
    // The question of the day: when do you start adding granularity???? (new nodes between nodes representing special relationships)
    // Answer: you add granularity when you need to encapsulate more information about the universe. It is motivated by information gravity.
    // we're sort of treating information gravity as a deus ex machina here but that's jsust for exploratory purposes.
    // ************
    // two types of algorithm:
    // - non greedy:
    //       * upon determining that the current information nexus encapsulates insufficient information, add a node
    // - greedy
    //       * add a node regardless, and cut if it is useless (provides no extra information) <--- this seems to be the neural mechanism
    //         with synaptic pruning.
