//
//  Note that the graphset is simply an extension of a
//  probability distribution, with discrete events;
//  if taken to the limit, it becomes a continuous distribution.
//  * Clearly, what we then need is a way to compare
//    discrete and continuous entropy measures
//    (or abstractions with something else)
//
//  Key, intuitive visualizations:
//  * energy: location of a particle.
//  * node: a subspace, or event space. 3D Rectangle.
//  * Abstraction: when a system doesn't know enough to
//    use the full granularity of an object, but the object
//    item exists (e.g. I know that if I turn on a computer,
//    it turns on, but not necessarily what the button did, or
//    all those little details.)
//      - The abstraction event space is strictly greater than
//        any singular instance of its more granular form.
//
//  Ok. Intution take two:
//  * The universe is simply an infinitely granular (continuouss)
//      field. This field acts on infinitely small particles.
//      The size of the particle is tied with the granularity of
//      the field. (after all, if the particle is not at all
//      granular in size, a granualr field is useless)
//  * We can assume right off the bat that these particles are
//      infinitely small in nature. We then look at integrals
//      or sum totals of particles, for that is something we can
//      measure.
//  * Each particle (doesn't need velocity: can encapsulate that
//      as another dimension? But then, how does it move? Are we
//      defining a location field?) simply has a location,
//      nothing else. All other properties can be derived.
//  * In this sense, the field is a "location field". Errr.
//      Something's not right. What about speed? To move b/w locs,
//      you gotta "move".
//  * These properties can be encapsulated in terms of fractions:
//      what fraction of particles moves on to each connected
//      space? (or node?), or stays?
//  * In this sense, the path of any given particle
//      is deterministic, but the work of abstraction makes
//      paths divergent.
//
//  Question: What reduces to a vector field? Can anything?
//  We might need a better way to define functions, over
//  infinity granularity (real-valued properties-->how?)
//  ^ can our minds do that? Tell the difference between
//    2 and 2.1222?
//
//  Intuition take 3:
//  * Ok. A graph is a discretized, abstracted field of some sort.
//  * We introduce the concept of energy: each property of a particle
//      (e.g. velocity) can simply be reduced to another dimension.
//      In that sense, each node has the same energy, and we are
//      defining an equi-energy field, where particles can go
//      however they please.
//  * Diffusion then takes over: particles may have some initial
//      movement, but no work is ever done on them. Hence, they act
//      sort of like molecules of a gas.
//  * This field is then not a force field, and cannot do any work.
//      Not entirely sure how to call it, or describe it.
//  * Reduces to defining fractional boundaries in space and
//      simulating with the diffusion method (see the simulateBehavior)

// represents a graph set.
// a graph set defines relationships between its content nodes.
// So far we enforce the fact that all nodes must be connected.
//
// note that the hierarchy can be collapsed by further defining a relationship
// "member" as simply being another connection in the flat graph.
// in that sense, the relationship flat graph is the more general form of this.
// In set theory, we can equate the braces with the arrows in the flat graph.
//
// Actually, not sure if that is true. But here's an interface where
// Each graphset represents an abstraction of an object.
// A graphset can be used as an interface, representing, for instance, the "relationship between x objects"
// For each graphset, you can then add granularity, or children, and define relationships between siblings.
// (Note: If you take a set of graphsets, you then have an object without abstraction.)
// (The way you interact with a set of graphsets is to take its abstraction and define granularity on that level)
//
// This implementation of a graphset is s.t.:
//      - each graphset is responsible for defining the relationships of its children. Let's just experiment.
//      - children do not define relationship with its parent.
//      - actually strike that. Let's just keep track of neighbors.
// Think hierarchally: We could also have every node describe all neighbors, but that's less intuitive in terms
// of the abstraction mechanism.
//
// OK. We need weights. No way around it... Why? A. it's equivalent to binary relationships. Ish.
// It just doesn't make sense to draw lots of duplicate simple binary relationships, or force that extra
// granularity, especially when the whole goal is to draw as few abstractions as possible while modeling
// an observed distribution successfully.
