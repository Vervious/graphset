//  Hopefully this can learn arbitrary turing computable functions.
//  All learning can be interpreted as being unsupervised, but in this case let's start
//  with a highly regimented supervised structure.
//  Inputs come in pairs:
//  First, an input.
//  Then, an output. (A classification)
//  Second, an input whether the output is right or wrong. This is the motivator.
//  -- repeat
//
//  Note the diference between the supervised and unsupervised scenarios. In the supervised
//  scenario, the best way to resonate with the input!!! (and maximize that information integral,
//  or whatever the theoretical basis is) is to be able to predict everything correctly.
//  That in and of itself is sufficient motivator.
//
//  We further restrict the space to the classification problem, expecting only a boolean output.
//  Only boolean actions may be taken. (Why not take more action? That reduces resonance. #TODO: prove)
//  #TODO: Prove that resonance equates to some function of information divergence.
//  #TODO: Equate graphset divergence with information divergence.
//  Again, having the right boolean output is the best way to resonate with the input.
